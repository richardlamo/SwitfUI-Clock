# SwitfUI-Clock
This is a simple SwiftUI Clock to demonstrate the timer and swiftui framework.

In this example of swiftui, two views are provided.
1. DigitalClockView - this is a simple digital clock
2. AnalogClockView - this is a more complex analog clock including a seconds hand.

The Analog clock demonstrates the use of SwiftUI TimelineView and drawing the clock hands using Canvas.
